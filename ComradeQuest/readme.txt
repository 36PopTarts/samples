Description and Contribution
--------
This is Comrade Quest, a game me and a team of 10 people made over the course of about four or five months.
I was one of the two dedicated programmers on this team.
Comrade Quest is a 2D beat-em-up platforming game. It's a tongue-in-cheek "communism" themed game in which
the player (and his or her partner) take on the role of Olaf, a KGB agent which possesses a beard with
supernatural powers. There is one finished level in the game that ends in a boss fight. The game is preferably
played with an Xbox 360 controller, but can also be played with keyboard. 
If you'd like to play this game, you MUST HAVE two players. The puzzles and fights are designed around 
two players, and the game only has a two-player mode. Also, keep in mind this game is rather difficult.
This game was made by avid gamers; that's why it's challenging.

My contribution was: the environment and interaction scripting, player movement, 
player attacking and hit detection, animation scripting, and the Communist summons feature.
The other programmer designed all of the AI for the game and the enemy attacks/behavior, 
along with the UI and camera movement/behavior, and the checkpoint/respawn system.

This game was made in Unity, and programmed in C#. I've included the source files for reference.
Just about everything in the "Attacks" and "Interactive" folder was programmed by me. 
I coded "ArenaControl.cs," "PlayerControl.cs," and "ActorControl.cs" in the "Behavior" 
folder, along with everything in the "Summons" subfolder. Everything in the "Animation" folder
was coded by me. The "Rendering" and "UI" folders can be credited to my partner.

Installation
-------
Just unzip Comrade Quest.exe and the data folder into a folder somewhere, and run Comrade Quest.exe.
